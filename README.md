**Bootstrap Buddy is a macOS authorization plugin created by Inetum Poland that enables MDM administrators to escrow the Bootstrap Token to an MDM server (if supported) on Mac computers that have failed to do so.**

It is entirely based on [Escrow Buddy](https://github.com/macadmins/escrow-buddy) from **Netflix Client Systems Engineering** team, so the credit goes to them.

## Requirements

- Managed Mac computers must:
  - be enrolled in an MDM
  - run macOS Ventura 13.3 or later[^1]
- The MDM must:
  - support Bootstrap Token escrow
  - be capable of installing packages[^2]

[^1]: While the authorization plugin itself requires only macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later, Bootstrap Token validation depends on functionality introduced in macOS 13.3.
[^2]: MDM server’s ability to run scripts is optional, but may be useful for deactivating, reactivating, or uninstalling the authorization plugin on demand.</sup>

## Deployment

Use your MDM to **install the [latest Bootstrap Buddy installer package](https://github.com/Inetum-Poland/bootstrap-buddy/releases/latest)** on your Mac computers.
And that’s it! The next time a Volume Owner logs into the Mac, a new Bootstrap Token will be escrowed to your MDM server.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> While you can install it on all machines, it is recommended to limit deployment to those requiring Bootstrap Token escrow/fix.

## Credits

Bootstrap Buddy was created by the **Apple Business Unit** at **Inetum Polska Sp. z o.o.**  
It is however entirely based on [Escrow Buddy](https://github.com/macadmins/escrow-buddy) created by the **Netflix Client Systems Engineering** team.

Local method of validating escrowed bootstrap token by verifying eligibility to perform _Erase All Content and Settings_ is based on the feature introduced in v. [3.0b11](https://github.com/Macjutsu/super/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#30b11) of the [S.U.P.E.R.M.A.N.](https://github.com/Macjutsu/super/tree/main) script by Kevin M. White, to whom the credit is due.

The [Crypt](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/crypt) project was a major inspiration in the creation of Escrow Buddy — huge thanks to Graham, Wes, and the Crypt team! Jeremy Baker and Tom Burgin’s 2015 PSU MacAdmins [session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcmql5byA_I) on authorization plugins was also a valuable resource.
